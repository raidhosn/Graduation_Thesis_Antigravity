    <p>Virtual Reality, despite being a recent paradigm, can be referenced from various perspectives, whether political, cultural, scientific, or technical. Given this diversity, it is necessary to ground it through concepts that can have a deeper relationship with it. Therefore, this chapter aims to provide an introductory character to the subjects of "Cyberspace," "Cybertime," and "Space and Time," which we understand to be the necessary light for the study of VR.</p>
    
    <h3 id="1-1-cyberspace">1.1. Cyberspace</h3>
    
    <p>The world is incredibly dynamic and constantly adapting to the demands of a more comfortable life filled with modern technologies. The most admirable thing about all this is that, when one notices such novelties, they are no longer novelties: they are everyday devices, a service built and embedded in daily life. The Internet is one of these technologies, which, through its surprising dissemination and evolution, contributes to the increasing mediation of human interaction by computers.</p>

    <p>LANCE STRATE (1996, Professor responsible for the Department of Communication and Media at Fordham University, New York), argues that such digital coexistence between people, connected by this virtual structure of worldwide scale and constant evolution, provides Cyberspace with the possibility of transcending all human creations, through support for the emergence of a distributed consciousness among thousands of people, separated by great physical distances, yet more capable of reacting as a group as members of a community (neighborhood friends, work colleagues, co-religionists, or family members).</p>

    <p>Thus, today Cyberspace is understood from two perspectives: as an information expressway, interconnected by computer network connections, and as Virtual Reality. In the first case, Cyberspace is seen as a "Highway" (electronic highway), on which a large number of people "travel" at all times, whether through the Internet, BBS, or Videotexts. In the second case, Cyberspace is associated with a projected virtual environment, capable of giving human beings conditions to experience a real or imaginary situation, as well as stimulating our bodily sensations, through immersion, that is, the sensation of being inside the environment, in a three-dimensional space.</p>

    <p>"We are moving toward a total interconnection of these two conceptions of Cyberspace, as networks will interconnect and, at the same time, allow interaction through 'virtual worlds' in three dimensions" ANDRÉ LEMOS (1996).</p>

    <p>However, there are different currents of thought that seek to define this issue. The sociologist ANDRÉ LEMOS, who is one of the great scholars and disseminators of VR today, is one of those who believes that in the future there will no longer be separation between these two currents of technology, as the quote above shows.</p>

    <p>However, although Cyberspace is a contemporary phenomenon, it is important to clarify that WILLIAM GIBSON (1984) in his book "Neuromancer," was the first, as far as we know, to use the term Cyberspace, interpreted more directly as "Cybernetic Space," to designate a graphical representation of data abstracted from the databases of all computers in the human system. GIBSON emphasizes:</p>

    <p>"(...)Cyberspace. A consensual hallucination experienced by billions of legitimate operators, in every nation, where mathematical concepts are taught to children... The graphical representation of data abstracted from the banks of every computer in the human system(...)"</p>

    <p>GIBSON described a universal computer network, containing all types of information, in which it would be possible to access and explore data in a multisensory way, states PIMENTEL (1995), and where people with implants in their bodies could transmit information directly to the computer. Consequently, GIBSON's neologism and his respective vision of the future originated in popular culture, a fact that prompted some to discredit the concept of Cyberspace he professed in his book cited above. However, others took the term and idea seriously, such as BENEDIKT (1991), one of the first architects of the concept of Cyberspace, editor of the book "Cyberspace: First Steps," who says:</p>

    <p>"Fully developed Cyberspace does not yet exist outside of science fiction and the imagination of a few hundred people" (1991, p.123).</p>

    <p>He then emphasizes:</p>

    <p>"Currently Cyberspace is under construction" (1991, p.124).</p>

    <p>He further describes Cyberspace as:</p>

    <p>"(...) a global network, sustained, accessed, generated by computers. Multidimensional, artificial or virtual reality in which each computer would be like a window, seen or heard by objects not necessarily physical, or representations of physical objects, but something in the form of characters and actions composed of data or information (..)" (p.122-123).</p>

    <p>BENEDIKT still seeks a bridge that unites science fiction and reality, but places his Cyberspace in the future.</p>

    <p>However, MICHAEL HEIM (1993 p.150), in his book "The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality," connects GIBSON's prophecy with current technologies in the following definition:</p>

    <p>"(...) The union of digital information and human perception, the Matrix of civilization where banks exchange money (credits) and information investigators navigate various layers of information, stored in virtual spaces. Buildings in Cyberspace must have more dimensions than physical buildings have, while Cyberspace must reflect different laws of existence. It is said that Cyberspace is where you are when you have a telephone conversation or where your electronic money flows to come into existence, or where electronic emails travel (...)"</p>

    <p>Thus, as cited above, HEIM implies that we have already entered the era of Cyberspace, in which his description merges with GIBSON's notion about the abstraction of data with the most common concepts of VR. For many, including BENEDIKT, the terms Cyberspace and Virtual Reality are synonymous.</p>

    <p>In a similar approach, HOWARD RHEINGOLD (1993, p.5), states in "Virtual Community: Homesteading on the Electronic Frontier" that:</p>

    <p>"(...) The spatial concept where words, human social relations, data, wealth and power, are manifested by people, using CMC (Computer Mediated Communications) technologies (...)" (1993, p. 5)</p>

    <p>PIERRE LEVY (1995), on the other hand, seeks to undo the opposition between the real and the virtual, reflecting on the possibilities that new media and cyberspace offer to make society a multifaceted organism of intelligent collectives. Without falling into awe at the speed of transmission and reception of information that the Internet favors, he highlights that the cultural revolution it triggers lies in the fact that it is an environment of shared memories, where virtual worlds are intermediaries of exchange not only of information but of the union of thoughts, where beyond memories, plans will be shared in the construction of a cooperative brain, consequently forming a network of community hypertexts. This sphere of sharing and circulation of data is what makes cyberspace a propitious environment for the development of collective intelligence. The socialization of messages is inherent to its own constitution, and this makes it the embryo of a techno-democracy:</p>

    <p>"(...) Now, cybernetic space, an interactive and community communication device, presents itself precisely as one of the privileged instruments of collective intelligence.<br />
    It is through it that, for example, professional training or distance education organizations develop cooperative learning systems in networks.(...) Researchers and students from around the world exchange ideas, articles, images in electronic conferences organized around nuclei of common interest.(...) Cybernetic space as a support for collective intelligence is one of the main conditions for the development of cybernetic space itself as a technical novelty.<br />
    (...) Furthermore, in those cases where collective intelligence processes effectively develop thanks to cybernetic space, its most notable effect is the acceleration of the pace of techno-social change (...). PIERRE LEVY (1997, p.3, Folha de São Paulo).</p>

    <p>For LEVY, in human intelligence its space is dispersed, its time is the eclipse, and its knowledge is the fragment. However, in collective intelligence we perceive the reintegration of these factors. LEVY encourages people to engage in the direction of collective intelligence, to invent themselves as a species, to discover or invent a collectivism beyond writing and language, such that information processing is disseminated and coordinated everywhere, in such a way that it naturally integrates all human activities, returning to the hands of society, transforming this conception of cyclical and cosmic time into the absolute simultaneity of events.</p>

    <p>LEVY believes that cyberspace will never be the creator of an intelligent society, however, it is the most propitious environment possible for its development:</p>

    <p>"It condenses all the ambivalence of contemporary communication technologies. It can become a tool of domination, through control of information circulation, but it can also constitute a space of infinite navigation. This would transform us into nomads of a new style, traversing spaces that metamorphose and bifurcate at our feet, forcing us to heterogenesis."</p>

    <p>The treatment given to Cyberspace in this thesis has a fundamentally introductory character, aiming to seek a comprehensive synthesis without excessive rigor in its definitions. The real objective is to draw a brief panorama of how VR technology can be influenced over this space, when applied to the individual, society, and the world in which we live.</p>

    <h3 id="1-2-space">1.2. Space</h3>

    <p>Today, a new generation of hardware technologies is being developed to integrate the physical body with Cyberspace. These technologies fall into two types of computational developments. The first is VR and the second is Ubiquitous Computing, that is, according to WEISER (1993, p. 7):</p>

    <p>"It is a computing environment in which each person is continuously interacting with hundreds of computers interconnected by a wireless network environment." However, it integrates computers with real space, where the boundaries between reality and Cyberspace are blurred or undefined"</p>

    <p>On the other hand, defining the concept of space is not an easy task, since it does not have a definitive and uniform form that represents it. Therefore, when we reference the variety of spaces that can be found, we will begin by contextualizing physical space, which theoretically exists independently of human presence.<br />
    Perceptive space, on the other hand, is defined as the impression of space obtained through the combination of any of our senses. However, because it is commonly confused with physical space, it can at most only correspond to a portion of it.</p>

    <p>EDWARD T. HALL (1966) in his book "Proxemics," states that there is also a tendency for perceptive space to be equated with visual space, in addition to confirming the existence of other spaces such as auditory, tactile, thermal, and generic olfactory. Consequently, perceptive space is based on the interactions of all these human senses.</p>

    <p>Another distinction that often leads to non-recognition is that established between perceptive space and conceptual space, where the sense of space is generated in our minds. Therefore, conceptual space can include memories of perceptive space, as well as fictitious and imaginary spaces that have never been perceived, but which are of fundamental importance, as they are where plans are made and future actions visualized, where we look when we turn inward through thought.</p>

    <p>HALL's investigations show that human beings have increased their senses of space based on interactions with existing others. There is, for example, a sense of personal space, one that represents an individualized space, territorially speaking, and a sense of social space, which represents an area that is shared with others. Our spaces are, furthermore, defined through verbal designations such as public or private, sacred or profane, and through physical modifications, such as architecture. A book, for example, occupies physical space as an object, enters into a spatial relationship with the reader, exposes information as words arranged on a page (many objects can be arranged in a given physical area), and must produce an additional experience of space in readers' imaginations through the decoding of its contents.</p>

    <p>Historically, with each new medium, new notions of space are introduced, such as written space and typographic space, but the most radical change is seen in the introduction of electronic media (telephone, radio, Internet...). These media create new forms of spatial relationships, as they tend to eliminate both the need for human presence and physical transport. For example, it is not entirely clear where your voice is when you talk on the phone (at the final end, at the signal output, or somewhere between these two extremes), just as it is not clear where you are, whether perceptually or conceptually. It is observed that a new sense of space is being created in a telephone conversation, which can be conceptualized as electronic space, state BOLTER, 1991 and ONG, 1982.</p>

    <p>MEYROWITZ (1985), says that electronic space is separated from any idea of physical location, characterized by providing a "sense of nowhere." In other words, all forms of space are cybernetic, and therefore all must be referred to as Cyberspace. However, even if this theoretical position of MEYROWITZ is admitted, for reasons of precision, it is favorable to limit the use of the term Cyberspace to these forms of electronic space and when associated with computer technologies. For the preceding decomposition of the varieties of spaces provides for the existence of different types of Cyberspace.</p>

    <p>There is, for example, the physical cyberspace of the computer itself, which is constituted by the structure of its chips, circuits, and architecture. This physical structure determines the possible patterns of electronic flow and therefore the basic operations of the computer. But there is also a logical cyberspace, which includes the computer's memory address.</p>

    <p>In relation to this chain of ideas, BOLTER (1984, p. 83) states:</p>

    <p>"(...) the range of numbers that can be related in the search and storage of data (...)"..</p>

    <p>Thus, logical cyberspace includes the locations where information is stored and processed in memory and the sectors and tracks where it is saved on optical or magnetic media. Consequently, physical cyberspace is almost never directly accessed, or even conceptualized by professionals in the Computer Science field, pronounces BOLTER:</p>

    <p>"This logical space exists in the programmer's mind(...) The programmer ignores such qualities that have no support in the solution to his problem (such as the pattern of electrical wires and transistors forming memory) and is left with the fundamental qualities of electronic space. Logical space is not computer memory freed from its physical limitations, since incorporating the reality of information into the computer imposes restrictions and offers possibilities that the programmer cannot totally ignore; it is computer memory reduced to its essence" (p. 84).</p>

    <p>Thus, BOLTER's description of logical space as an abstract, geometric, and mathematical field in which the programmer can build his data structures has much in common with GIBSON's description of a fictitious cyberspace based on the visualization of abstract data.</p>

    <p>As RHEINGOLD (1991) suggests, the evolution of computer technology has been in the direction of distancing between user and hardware, thus reducing or eliminating access to physical cyberspace. Therefore, through the development of various interfaces, computers have created a perceptive cyberspace, which should include the visual space of the computer monitor, graphical user interfaces, and tactile input devices, such as the keyboard, joystick, and mouse. At the same time, the ability to go beyond our perceptions, particularly through computer-mediated verbal communication, results in a form of conceptual cyberspace.</p>

    <p>Therefore, human perceptions and concepts have built the experience of cyberspace and through human-computer interaction or computing for interpersonal communication, a kind of personal cyberspace has been generated that includes a sense of territoriality directed at personal "desktops" and arrangements of files and directories, workspaces in the main structures of computers and the senses involved that verify how we move at different levels of computers or how we can connect to them, whether by our personal senses of cyberspace, in which it can be said that there is a fusion of the human being with the computer, making them "Cyborgs."</p>

    <p>One can also enter a shared social cyberspace, such as a discussion list; generally, those who gain a sense of group in a virtual community also develop a sense of responsibility toward a social cyberspace in which they are situated, since, as residents of a neighborhood, they can take responsibility for cleaning and security of the area.</p>

    <p>Finally, the relationships between conceptual, perceptive, and physical spaces have been the subject of study of various debates over the centuries, whether together, in the same physical space, or geographically separated by real distances that networks eliminate, enabling students and teachers to develop cooperative work, consult distant databases and distant specialists, deepening their knowledge.</p>

    <p>The intention of this work is not to enter into such a discussion, but merely to highlight the distinctions, because these three types form the basis for all other forms of experienced space, as well as for the creation of an ideal virtual environment.</p>

    <p>With VR, this capacity can go beyond what is imagined, allowing the creation of shared virtual workspaces, where participants see more or less realistic representations of each other (clones), and can even work together.</p>

    <h3 id="1-3-cybertime">1.3. Cybertime</h3>

    <p>In archaic societies, time is ahistorical, non-linear, governed by mystical experience and not by the succession of events. Primitive man has a connection with the cosmos, with abstract time. Primitives lived in a "continuous present." Time is natural, marked by fire, water, and earth. Measured by cycles: seasonal, solar, menstrual, etc. The cyclical character, in which time begins again, passes through the regeneration and updating of phenomena proper to the people and situations of these communities.</p>

    <p>It is observed that in the computer age, Cybertime by itself represents the interaction of several different phenomena. First, there is the time-counting function in computers as the computer builds an internal sensitivity to time and measures the passage of time in the external world to coordinate actions and events. Second, there is the representation function of the computer, such as a messenger, it carries a dramatic, fictional, or symbolic sense of time, as well as a sense of past, present, and future. Third, there is our own subjective experience of time, such as when we interact with and through computer technologies, as processing constitutes a human activity and is an event that influences our perception of time and our own sense of self and community.</p>

    <p>Traditionally, the origins of the computer are traced from devices that aided in numerical calculations such as the abacus, or from machines that performed control functions, such as JACQUARD's automatic looms; as a revolutionary technological innovation, comparisons were also made with the steam engine and GUTENBERG's press, according to TOFFLER in 1981. However, almost always forgotten is the close kinship between the computer and the mechanical clock developed in the Middle Ages. Scientist J. DAVID BOLTER (1984), one of the few to make this connection, argues:</p>

    <p>"The computer is an extension of the clock more than the steam engine. The clock provides information in a more convenient and eventually more precise way than the sundial ever did in the past, but does not physically interfere in life except by the alarm." (1984).</p>

    <p>Like ancient computers, ancient clocks were expensive and delicate, requiring a cooperative effort to acquire one. When clocks became common, however, they became not just merely useful but inevitable. Men and women began to work, eat, and sleep according to the clock, and as soon as they decided to regulate their actions through this arbitrary measure of time, the clock was transformed from an expression of civic pride into a necessity of urban life. The computer has also been transformed from a luxury item into a necessity for business, government, and modern society.</p>

    <p>Computers and clocks are both devices that do not produce material products, but pure information; the arbitrariness of the uniform hours and minutes produced by the clock implies that, like the computer, the clock is a simulation technology. Moreover, as LEWIS MUMFORD (1963) made clear:</p>

    <p>"The main function of the clock is to coordinate and synchronize activities and events. It is an ancient control technology, precursor to cybernetics and computing" (1963).</p>

    <p>Another observation about this subject was made by BOLTER (1984) and LEVY (1992), who stated:</p>

    <p>"Clocks are automata forms, self-sufficient machines, and moreover, ancestors of the modern VON NEUMANN computer."</p>

    <p>BOLTER's conception of the clock situates computers within a long tradition of chronological technology. This has much affinity with McLUHAN's (1964) placement, where the fragmentary structure of modern mechanical work was defined by the clock. Time or duration was conceived as having a uniform size, just like the letters of the alphabet or more recently information in bits. This structure, known as the "standardization of time," was the foundation of the clock of the industrial era, states McLUHAN (1964).</p>

    <p>A century ago, time standards determined the manufacturing of railroad schedules and mass communication media. Artificial satellites brought an era of global time through international television broadcasts, while contemporary computer technologies have brought us electronic "instantaneity," state McLUHAN and POWERS (1989).</p>

    <p>Thus, the computer has been perfecting our capacity for time compression and digital media are creating a new sense of time, known as Cybertime. Cybertime is associated with Cyberculture, given that, as some suggest, it represents a postmodern culture, MAFFESOLI (1995).</p>

    <p>Pre-modern culture was strongly centered on what EDWARD HALL (1983) called sacred time, or transcendent time, as it is a spiritual means of escaping from the endless flow of everyday life. In pre-modern cultures, sacred time was mythical time, or the time of cultural narratives, of cosmology and theology. It is eternal, divine time, out of time, the standard by which human temporality was measured.</p>

    <p>In the industrial era, profane time was standardized and fragmented. The clock was replacing the natural rhythm of pre-modern cultures, the industrial way of life made humanity's relationship with the seasonal cycle less urgent, thus weakening the orientation of sacred time. In a critique of Marxism, MAFFESOLI (1995, p. 31) proposes to think contemporary culture, observing the emergence of new post-industrial values. With post-industrialism, such values emerge, such as: the connection between globalism and tribalism, small groups or "tribes," archaism and the technological, communication, shared emotion, hedonism, mysticism, among other categories. For electronic relationships transcend uniform measures of time, thus freeing individuals from obedience to the standardized and fragmented clock and showing openness to the new rhythms and new cycles implied by Cybertime, which, after all, is the sacred time of the post-industrial era.</p>

    <p>BENEDIKT (1991) describes sacred time as a time of ritual and symbolic interaction with friends and family, with "inner" communities such as dream worlds. He suggests that cyberspace has a very intimate relationship with this sphere of experience. Likewise, the experience of cyberspace is one of escape from the daily routine of ordinary physical reality, an entry into new spaces and times, through a symbolic portal. The entry point is more than a software interface, no less than a sacred site, suggesting that digital technology is imbued with spiritual meaning.</p>

    <p>The advent of Cybertime also parallels the development of entertainment time. Television, theater, cinema, amusement parks, etc., offer escape from work time that dominates our daily life, during breaks, weekends, and vacations. Entertainment time is filling life with pleasure and leisure. Because it is associated with fantasy and the experience of story narratives (sometimes true, sometimes false), it can be seen as a secularized version of sacred time.</p>

    <p>Thus, we can understand digital media as an extension of entertainment and, therefore, as a fusion of sacred time, profane time, and entertainment time. Consequently, it can be suggested that VR represents an attempt to synthesize these three categories of time, in such a way that it seems to produce a separate space-time experience, representing a new type of time.</p>

    <p>This chapter seeks to conceptualize VR through a comprehensive synthesis of the definitions and ideas elaborated by the main researchers in the field, as well as to identify the factors that together define it (immersion, interaction, and involvement), its historical structure, in order to highlight its evolution.</p>

    <h3>2.1. HISTORY</h3>

    <p>The origin of VR history is controversial and depends largely on what is considered "virtual reality." Environment simulation can be considered the seed of virtual reality. In fact, in the 1950s, flight simulators were already emerging in the USA; these were a reality for training pilots of the American Air Force. The need to simulate flight situations such as: takeoff, flight, landing, and failure, caused such systems to evolve in order to provide better training for pilots.</p>

    <p>MORTON HELLIG, a cinematographer, described and patented in 1962 a simulator called "Sensorama." His system consisted of a device for viewing films in a 3D environment; additionally, movements, sounds, and aromas could be felt. Interestingly, HELLIG had a vision far ahead of his time, building what he called the "Cinema of the Future," in an attempt to create what we now call virtual environments. In the same year that "Sensorama" was registered, the first VR helmets were already being sold commercially, although there is no reference to them. In Figure 1 we present the machine called "Sensorama," now retired, and in Figure 2 the "Super Cockpit," a term used to designate one of the first experiences of immersive VR, used in training military pilots in flight simulators.</p>

    <p>In 1965, IVAN SUTHERLAND (considered the greatest researcher in the field of Computer Graphics) created a display device, which was the precursor of today's systems. This device was the first system to use a head apparatus: the "HMD (Head Mounted Display)." With helmets, immersion in the virtual environment was possible. The helmets were equipped with position sensors, which enabled the capture of a user's head movements, sending them to a computer. The computer was responsible for "rendering" (generating) the images seen by the user through their glasses.</p>

    <p>The images were generated in real time, that is, with each movement of the user the computer was responsible for "rendering" the corresponding image to that position. Thus, it was possible for the user to observe their virtual environment around them, looking up, to the sides, and down; and the machine (computer) was responsible for generating for their HMD, images of their environment that corresponded to their observation point. The HMDs we know today derive from those developed by SUTHERLAND.</p>

    <p>In Figures 3 and 4, two perspectives of different displays can be visualized.</p>

    <p>One of these systems is AR (Augmented Reality), which allows the user, through the use of a transparent display, to view both the surrounding environment and images or data (Figure 5). Some systems allow interaction between real and virtual environments, so that, for example, the user's hand can be used to manipulate virtual objects. This area currently falls under Augmented Reality (AR).</p>

    <p>In 1975, MYRON KRUEGER created a videoconference using computer-generated silhouettes, through projectors, cameras, and image projection screens. With this system, participants could remotely communicate and interact with each other. KRUEGER called this type of system Artificial Reality. Currently, this videoconferencing system is known as "Telepresence" and will be defined in this chapter.</p>

    <p>In 1982, THOMAS ZIMMERMAN invented and patented a data glove (later known as DataGlove), using fiber optic sensors attached to the fingers. The glove was originally invented to be used as a musical data input interface, capable of transforming movements into sounds. In 1984, ZIMMERMAN and JARON LANIER formed the company VPL Inc., manufacturer of various VR equipment. In 1989, Autodesk, Inc. presented a series of VR programs for a PC (Personal Computer).</p>

    <h3>2.2 DEFINITIONS</h3>

    <p>It can be stated that Virtual Reality was born and developed through the union of researchers from Simulation, Scientific Visualization, Advanced Interfaces, Robotics, and Computer Networks, who had as a common interest the development of a new application interface, implying the manipulation of an interactive three-dimensional environment generated by computer. Furthermore, from the effort of these researchers, a new interface paradigm resulted, where the user stopped interacting "with the machine" but rather "through the machine," seeking the elimination of any type of barriers that impede interaction and communication between both.</p>

    <p>For the existence of Virtual Reality, three factors are considered essential for it to actually occur: immersion, interaction, and involvement with the virtual environment. These are perceived, in one way or another, in almost all types of Virtual Reality, although each of them is in different proportions (KIRNER, 1996, PIMENTEL, 1995, JACOBSON, 1994).</p>

    <h3>2.2.1. Immersion</h3>

    <p>The sensory immersion of an individual in an environment can be achieved when the device manages to capture the attention of all their senses, in such a way that they forget the reality around them. Interface devices are equipment used to: capture movements (glasses, helmet, gloves, and clothes); stimulate the senses (monitor, speakers, special visualization glasses).</p>

    <p>A question that would certainly be asked in this statement is: would a good book be a "type" of Virtual Reality? It would be, if we abstract the adjective virtual present in the expression. VR requires a sensation of being physically inserted in the environment, such as that achieved by using three-dimensional visualization devices attached to the head (Figure 6).</p>

        Figure 6 - Immersive VR System
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Immersion is linked to the feeling of "being present" inside the environment, therefore, it can be of two types: passive immersion, the greater the system's ability to deceive the senses, the greater the sensation of being present in the virtual environment, the observer being a mere contemplator of the virtual world; active immersion when the devices used allow manipulation of the world (MCLELLAN, 1995), that is, the participant interacts with the virtual world and it reacts to their actions. A widely researched form of immersive VR today is "telepresence" (Figure 7), which occurs when the operator has the sensation of being physically present in a remote location through all forms of media. If the environment (or world) exists only inside the computer, the term "virtual presence" is more appropriate, but very little used, just observe Chats and online RPG games, such as, for example, "Ultima Online," widely played via the Internet, where the expression "virtual presence" would apply better than "virtual reality," as its objective is limited to human-machine interaction.</p>

    <figure className="my-8">

        Figure 7 - Telepresence
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The existing environments directly influence Telepresence: Virtual Environments and Remote Environments.</p>

    <p>Virtual environments (Figure 8) are those generated by computer, allowing the operator to explore them via Telepresence, such as distance learning, virtual meetings, or teleconference.</p>

    <figure className="my-6">
      <img src={figura8SistemaAmbienteVirtual} alt="Virtual Environment System" className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-md" />
      <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-2 italic">
        Figure 8 - Virtual Environment System
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Remote environments, on the other hand, are those in which the operator uses telerobots, equipped with video cameras and other sensors to manipulate objects in environments that are difficult to access or that put their life at risk, such as repairs on a space station, maintenance in a nuclear reactor, exploration of planets.</p>

    <p>An important aspect also in Telepresence is the growing concern about technological advances that make robotic systems highly complicated structures, overloading operators with the complexity and quantity of controls. Thus, the great goal of Telepresence is to produce a transparent human-machine interface, so that information can be transmitted as naturally between the operator and the environment, that the user can feel completely immersed in the virtual environment.</p>

    <p>Regarding VR applications, one can also perceive the degree of existing immersion, when exemplified through remote medicine. Currently, the "talk of the moment" is the possibility of a patient, for example, being operated on in a room equipped with cameras, microphones, telerobots, and monitoring systems, with the specialist in another geographical location. NASA is very interested in this subject and is developing a Telepresence project to perform eventual medical operations on astronauts in space stations.</p>

    <p>In Chapter VII, the issue of applicability in VR will be better explored, where several immersive experiences in various areas of knowledge will be mentioned, with Chapter VI only interested in emphasizing it with the immersive issue.</p>

    <p>Figures 9 and 10 represent a medical surgery using VR.</p>

    <p>MICHAEL HEIM (1993), in his book "The Metaphysics of Virtual Reality," also treats Telepresence as one of the concepts that define VR, as well as viewing it from an immersive point of view. Other researchers such as JACOBSON (1994), PIMENTEL (1995), and MACHOVER (1994) share the same opinion.</p>

    <p>HEIM speaks of the variety of concepts currently driving VR, including beyond immersion, interaction and involvement, concepts such as simulation, artificiality, and networked communication.</p>

    <p>The realism of simulations also applies to sound systems. Three-dimensional sound systems control every point of digital acoustic space, and their precision exceeds previous sound systems, demonstrating that three-dimensional audio contributes to VR. Beyond the visual and auditory factor, devices linked with other senses also contribute to simulation realism, such as sound, automatic positioning of the person and head movements, reactive controls, etc.</p>

    <p>On the other hand, the paradigm of artificiality began to create interactive environments in which the user can transcend their own limits. In society our acts are surrounded by pressures and limits, in the virtual the presence of these limits becomes smaller, because there is no notion of space or real consequences. This moves the individual from a position of reaction to the social environment to a position of free action, in which they do what they would most like to do. With this comes the therapy of thinking and acting freely, even if it is virtual action. This "therapy" positions us in a new pattern of thought, exercises our imagination, since without it there is no action at all, because in the virtual there are no concrete facts that induce us to a reaction. It enables us to deal with zones of experience never "trodden," that is, it makes us transcend our own limits. And ultimately it makes us realize that the virtual is as possible to be real as we had never imagined.</p>

    <p>It is interesting to note that the issue of virtualization, that is, the use of imagination, is not current, but rather computing, which has provided us with totally new tools. The virtual has been present since the reading or creation of a book, to the RPG game, in children's play, in a dream, that is, wherever our imagination or the creative process is present.</p>

    <p>Another aspect to point out is found in networked communications, which has as one of its pioneers JARON LANIER (1985), who also accepts the immersion model in VR. On the other hand, he seeks to emphasize it to other essential aspects.</p>

    <p>Because computers allow the interconnection of networks, VR seems a candidate for a new means of communication. The RB2 (Reality Built for Two) system of VPL (Visual Programming Language) 1985 highlights the connectivity of virtual worlds. In this view, a virtual world is at most a shared construction, as a telephone is. Virtual worlds, then, can evoke unprecedented paths of sharing, what LANIER calls "post-symbolic communication." Because users can stipulate and form objects and activities of a virtual world, they can share imaginary things and events without using words or real-world references.</p>

    <p>Appropriately, communication can go beyond verbal or body language to assume magical and alchemical properties. A virtual world maker could beg so far for wonderful mixtures of vision, sound, and movement. Consciously built outside the grammar and syntax of language, these "signals" defy the traditional logic of verbal and visual information. VR can transmit resources kinetically and cinematically. Such communication will probably require elaborate protocols, as well as long periods of time to digest what was communicated. On the other hand, such an idea of networked communications may even be unfeasible or difficult to realize, but it is a vision that drives many people in VR.</p>

    <p>Few things in VR have not been imagined in other forms of art and technology. Therefore, the recent explosion of interest has to do with the dramatic increase in computational power and access to it, given that there is more computational power in the average desktop than in the first ENIAC computer, where the new generation of personal computers has been described as "Desktop Mainframes."</p>

    <p>VR can become a powerful new medium, intimately linked to the goal of making the user no longer a passive observer. Certainly, this can have as much impact on human communications as the press, the camera, the cinematographic film, and television itself.</p>

    <p>Thus, when we reference TEIXEIRA (1997), addressed in the book "COMMUNICATION AND CYBERSPACE," we perceive the search to contextualize VR, according to the opinion that it offers different perspectives to human-machine interaction, using combinations of technologies whose interfaces with human users can dominate their senses, so that they interact with an immersive and dynamic environment generated by computer.</p>

    <p>Consequently, when we reconcile the definitions of BURDEA (1994), JACOBSON (1991), KIRNER (1996), and KRUGER (1911), it can be considered that the structure of VR is an advanced interface technique, where the user can effect immersion, navigation, and interaction in a three-dimensional synthetic environment reproduced by computer, using multi-sensory channels in real time, where each sensory modality requires a simulation prepared especially for its specific case.</p>

    <p>In Figure 11, we see a Virtual Reality System composing all the processes defined in this chapter.</p>

    <p>VR systems differ from each other taking into account the level of immersion and interactivity provided to the participant. Both are determined according to the types of input and output devices used in the VR system in addition to the speed and power of the computer that supports the VR system (JACOBSON, 1994). Of course, everything will depend on the purpose of the system.</p>

    <p>The devices used in VR are strongly multisensory, using 3D graphics, specially distributed sound outputs, voice input, eye movement, gestures, and some mechanism that is linked with the sense of touch or force, and there are also sensors responsible for the last frontier of interaction. As a consequence, the connection between the user and the virtual environment is generally much more intense than in other conventional applications.</p>

    <p>According to PIMENTEL and TEIXEIRA (1995) these VR styles could be classified as: simulation virtual reality, projection virtual reality, augmented reality, physical devices, telepresence, visually coupled displays, desktop virtual reality, hypertext, 3D sound, and cyborg.</p>

    <h3>3.1. SIMULATION VR</h3>

    <p>Simulation VR represents the oldest type of VR system because it originated with flight simulators developed by the American military after World War II (JACOBSON, 1994).</p>

    <p>A Simulation VR system basically imitates the interior of a car, airplane, or jet, placing the participant inside a cockpit with controls. Inside this cockpit, video screens and monitors present a virtual world that reacts to the user's commands. Since the Simulation VR system does not process stereo images, the images appear quite fast (JACOBSON, 1994). In some systems the cockpits are mounted on mobile platforms (PIMENTEL, 1995), in addition to having controls with tactile and auditory feedback (JACOBSON, 1994).</p>

    <p>Figures 12 and 13 demonstrate Forms of Simulation VR.</p>

    <h3>3.2. PROJECTION VIRTUAL REALITY</h3>

    <p>JACOBSON, in 1994, says that Projection Artificial Reality was created in the 1970s by MYRON KRUEGER, characterizing it by the user being outside the virtual world, but on the other hand, could communicate with characters or objects inside it.</p>

    <p>KRUEGER, at the same time, created a Projection VR System, which he called VIDEOPLACE (projection room or place), which captured images of one or more users and projected them on a large screen that represented a virtual world, where the interaction of these users with each other or with objects was possible. The term Virtual Reality, created by KRUEGER, was simply to describe the type of environment created by his system, which could be used without the need for the participant to use data input devices, states JACOBSON.</p>

    <p>Figures 14 and 15 demonstrate Forms of Projection VR.</p>

    <h3>3.3. AUGMENTED REALITY</h3>

    <p>Augmented Reality uses transparent visual devices attached to the head on which data is projected. Because these displays are transparent, the user can see data, diagrams, animations, and 3D graphics without ceasing to see the real world, having information superimposed on the real world. These transparent displays are called Heads Up Displays (HUDs) because they allow this vision through computer-generated information. The user can, for example, be repairing something and viewing on the glasses the data necessary for this operation (PIMENTEL and TEIXEIRA, 1995).</p>

    <p>As for the Augmented Reality System (Figure 18), it is a combination of the view of the real environment with the virtual environment (Figure 8). This type of system is obtained by merging telepresence systems (Figure 7) and VR.</p>

    <h3>3.4. PHYSICAL DEVICES</h3>

    <p>Physical devices seek to stimulate physical sensations, such as touch, muscle tension, and temperature (GRADECKI, 1994). Unlike vision and hearing output devices, physical devices require a sophisticated electromechanical interaction with the user's body. The technology currently existing is not capable of stimulating physical senses with the level of realism that it achieves with visual and auditory senses: the problem is beyond the creation of feedback devices, as it also involves the understanding and simulation of appropriate forces (PIMENTEL, 1995).</p>

    <h3>3.4.1. Tactile Feedback</h3>

    <p>Tactile feedback is the name given to systems that transmit sensations that act on the skin. Tactile feedback (Figure 19) should provide not only the sensation of touch but also allow the user to perceive whether they are touching a smooth or rough surface (GRADECKI, 1994). There are currently two different ways to do this tactile simulation: through air pressure and through vibrations (PIMENTEL, 1995).</p>

    <figure className="my-8">

      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>3.4.2. Force Feedback</h3>

    <p>The skin only perceives the surface of the touched object. The perception of volume and resistance of the object is perceived by sensors inside muscles and in the joints (GRADECKI, 1994). Thus, the simulation of these sensations would allow the creation of solid virtual objects. However, the creation of force feedback is complex because, in addition to determining which forces are most important for simulation, the system must transmit these forces exactly at the corresponding physical points (PIMENTEL, 1995).</p>

    </figure>

    <h3>3.5. TELEPRESENCE</h3>

    <p>According to PIMENTEL (1995), Telepresence could have been defined as the set of technologies that allow a person to feel present in a remote location, geographically distant. The Telerobot, shown in figure 21, is controlled by the user of a workstation and instead of the robot being programmed to perform certain tasks, it acts as a slave of the user.</p>

    <figure className="my-8">
      <img src={figura21Telerobot} alt="Figure 21 - Telerobot" className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg" />

        Figure 21 - Telerobot
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>NASA was the first to use this type of application, using robots on the lunar surface. Figure 22 refers to the Pathfinder, which was recently used on a mission to Mars. This "Telerobot" proved extremely efficient. Through it and with its video camera, it was possible to visualize the surface of Mars, in addition to collecting data.</p>

    <h3>3.6. VISUALLY-COUPLED DISPLAYS</h3>

    <p>According to JACOBSON (1994), Visually-coupled displays are generic names given to any display used in conjunction with some type of device that determines the position of the user's gaze to generate a different image with each movement.</p>

    <p>There are two types of visually coupled displays: HMDs (head mounted displays) and BOOMs (Binocular Omni-Oriented Monitors).</p>

    <p>HMDs are displays mounted on the head as helmets or glasses. SUTHERLAND created the first HMDs in 1965. BOOMs are displays suspended by articulated arms that are attached to a fixed structure. Unlike HMDs, which adjust to the user, the individual who observes stereo images in the BOOM is the one who moves the display to obtain a view of the virtual environment (Figure 23).</p>

    <h3>3.7. DESKTOP VIRTUAL REALITY</h3>

    <p>In Desktop VR, the virtual environment is seen on the computer screen. According to JACOBSON (1994), with the help of special glasses, it is possible to obtain three-dimensional images on the computer screen; for this, two slightly different images are generated and each eye will focus on one, depending on who is watching. Subsequently, each image is merged into one that will be seen on the monitor (Figure 25).</p>

    <figure className="my-8">
      <img src={figura25DesktopVr} alt="Figure 25 - Desktop VR" className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg" />

        Figure 25 - Desktop VR
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <h3>3.8. HYPERTEXT</h3>

    <p>According to TEIXEIRA (1997), the term "Hypertext" was created by THEODORE H. NELSON to express the idea of non-linear writing/reading in a computer system. His appearance in NELSON's work was during the sixties, when he was participating in a project at Brown University, which resulted in a prototype of a hypertext word processor, the Hypertext Editing System.</p>

    <p>To understand hypertext, PIMENTEL (1993) conceptualizes it as a text without sequence, which can be read and reread in the way chosen by the reader. Hypertext can be associated with other hypertexts, Internet pages, sounds, graphics, images, and videos (hypermedia). This freedom of navigation makes reading interactive and immersive.</p>

    <figure className="my-8">
      <img src={figura26Hipertexto} alt="Figure 26 - Hypertext" className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
      <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-3 italic">
        Figure 26 - Hypertext
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The concept that best summarizes hypertext is a text structured as a network. The network is the center of a hypertext system; all other components, including texts, are organized for its operation.</p>

    <h3>3.9. CYBORG</h3>

    <p>In this section, we do not intend to be exhaustive, nor is it our intention to exhaust the subject, since Cyborgs would deserve an entire separate study to contextualize the issue. However, the subject "Cyborg" is introduced in this work to corroborate the sense that there is an unfolding of the context of immersion beyond everyday issues on the subject.</p>

    <p>According to ANDRÉ LEMOS (1997), in his "Cyborg Page," anyone who uses a technological device as part of their daily functions has already become a cyborg. Cell phones, pagers, computers, industrialized foods, and body prostheses are some examples of how we are becoming cyborgs and living in a "Cyborg Culture."</p>

    <p>Cyborgs (CYBernetic ORGanisms) or Machinic Beings are hybrid human beings, where the biological body is combined with artificial intelligences (chips, electronic implants, artificial organs) or prosthetic devices. The term was coined by Manfred Clynes in the early sixties, in research on men in space for NASA.</p>

    <figure className="my-8">
      <img src={figura27Ciborg} alt="Figure 27 - Cyborg" className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
      <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-3 italic">

      <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-3 italic">
        Figure 28 - Cyborg
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The cyborg, which we only knew through science fiction movies, is already in our daily lives. Today, entering cyberspace (whether through Internet connections or through Virtual Reality environments) already presupposes that our body has been displaced to another space (cyberspace). Connection, in this sense, means cyborg, that is, symbiosis of our body with organs and devices that form an interface with the parallel worlds of contemporary computerization.</p>

    <p>Cyborg culture is the mark of our time, whether through bodies modified by drugs, silicones, and prostheses, or through the fusion of the biological with electronic devices. Thus, contemporary culture elects new icons. If in the past the myths were the anthropomorphized gods of ancient Greece, if in modernity we began to deify machines, today, the myths of the Western imagination are the androids and cyborgs that seek a humanity. Thus, cyborg culture represents the attempt to find the human lost in technocratic civilization.</p>

    <p>Virtual Reality devices constitute the physical interface between the user and the virtual environment. These equipment are responsible for capturing the user's movements and actions, transmitting them to the computational system, and returning sensory stimuli that create the illusion of presence in a synthetic world. The evolution of these devices has been fundamental to the advancement of VR technology.</p>

    <h3>4.1. VISUAL DEVICES</h3>

    <p>Visual devices are the most important components of a Virtual Reality system, as vision is the predominant sense in human perception. These devices aim to present stereoscopic images to the user, creating the illusion of depth and three-dimensionality.</p>

        Figure 29 - Head-Mounted Display (HMD) for VR immersion
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The Head-Mounted Display (HMD), or Visualization Helmet, is the most common visual device in immersive VR systems. It consists of a helmet equipped with two small liquid crystal displays (LCD) or cathode ray tubes (CRT) positioned in front of the user's eyes. Each screen displays a slightly different image, corresponding to the perspective of each eye, thus creating the stereoscopic effect.</p>

    <figure className="my-8">
      <img src={figura30HmdSensores} alt="Figure 30 - HMD with Sensors" className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg" />
      <figcaption className="text-center text-sm text-muted-foreground mt-3 italic">
        Figure 30 - HMD equipped with tracking sensors
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>Modern HMDs incorporate tracking sensors that detect the orientation and position of the user's head. These sensors allow the system to update images in real-time, following the user's movements and maintaining the coherence of the virtual environment.</p>

        Figure 31 - HMD system developed by NASA
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>NASA was a pioneer in developing HMDs for space applications, creating systems that allowed astronauts to train maintenance and equipment operation procedures in a simulated environment before performing them in space.</p>

    <figure className="my-8">
      <img src={figura32FakespaceBoom} alt="Figure 32 - BOOM Fakespace" className="w-full max-w-2xl mx-auto rounded-lg shadow-lg" />

        Figure 34 - Users inside a CAVE system
      </figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p>The CAVE (Cave Automatic Virtual Environment) represents a different approach to VR visualization. Developed at the University of Illinois in 1992, it consists of a cubic room where images are projected onto the walls, ceiling, and floor. Users wear lightweight stereoscopic glasses and can walk freely within the environment, being tracked by sensors.</p>

    <h3>4.2. TRACKING SYSTEMS</h3>

    <p>Tracking systems are responsible for detecting the position and orientation of the user and objects in real space, translating this data to the virtual environment. There are several tracking technologies, each with its advantages and limitations.</p>

    <p>Electromagnetic tracking uses a transmitter that generates magnetic fields and receivers positioned on the user's body. The field intensity at each receiver allows calculating its position relative to the transmitter. This method offers good accuracy but is sensitive to interference from metallic objects.</p>

    <p>Optical tracking uses cameras that capture reflective markers or LEDs positioned on the user. Triangulation of images from multiple cameras allows determining the three-dimensional position of markers with high precision.</p>

    <p>Mechanical tracking employs articulated structures with angle sensors at each joint. Although precise, it limits the user's movements to the range of the mechanical structure.</p>

    <p>Acoustic tracking uses ultrasonic emitters and microphones to measure sound propagation time and calculate distances. It is less accurate than other methods but offers relatively low cost.</p>

    <h3>4.3. IMAGE PROCESSING</h3>

    <p>Real-time image processing is one of the greatest technical challenges in Virtual Reality. To maintain the illusion of presence, the system must generate and display images at a minimum rate of 20 to 30 frames per second, ideally 60 or more. Any perceptible delay between the user's movements and visual update can cause discomfort and nausea.</p>

    <p>Graphics accelerator cards are specialized components that perform the calculations necessary for 3D rendering. These devices have dedicated processors for geometry manipulation, texturing, lighting, and other visual effects.</p>

    <p>High-quality VR systems frequently employ multiple graphics processors working in parallel, each responsible for generating the image of a portion of the field of view or one of the eyes.</p>

    <h3>4.4. INPUT DEVICES</h3>

    <p>Virtual Reality represents one of the most significant evolutions in the human-computer interface since the advent of the personal computer. Throughout this work, we have explored the fundamental concepts, different forms of implementation, technological devices, and diverse applications of this emerging technology.</p>

    <p>The study of Cyberspace, Space, and Cybertime has allowed us to understand the conceptual framework that underlies Virtual Reality. These concepts transcend mere technology, touching on fundamental philosophical questions about the nature of reality, perception, and human experience.</p>

    <p>The different forms of Virtual Reality - from simulation to telepresence, from augmented reality to projection systems - demonstrate the versatility of this technology. Each approach offers specific advantages and finds applications in different contexts.</p>

    <p>Virtual Reality devices continue to evolve rapidly. Visualization helmets become lighter and with higher resolution. Data gloves offer greater precision and tactile feedback. Tracking systems achieve previously unimaginable levels of accuracy. This technological evolution constantly expands the possibilities of VR.</p>

    <p>The applicability of Virtual Reality extends to virtually all areas of human activity. From medicine to education, from entertainment to engineering, from arts to business, VR is transforming the way we work, learn, communicate, and have fun.</p>

    <p>However, significant challenges remain. The cost of equipment, although constantly decreasing, still limits the dissemination of technology. Ergonomic issues, such as discomfort and nausea in some users, need to be resolved. The need for great computational power for real-time rendering continues to be a technical obstacle.</p>

    <p>Looking to the future, it is possible to foresee an ever-greater integration between the real and virtual worlds. Augmented Reality, which overlays digital information onto the physical environment, promises to be one of the next technological frontiers. The convergence between VR, artificial intelligence, and telecommunications will create new forms of experience and interaction.</p>

    <p>This work sought to present a comprehensive panorama of Immersive Virtual Reality in the context of the late 1990s. Although technology continues to evolve rapidly, the fundamental concepts presented here remain relevant to understanding this fascinating area of computing.</p>

    <p>Virtual Reality is not just a technology - it is a new form of experience, a medium that allows expanding the limits of human perception and exploring worlds that exist only in the imagination. The future of VR is being built now, and its potential is limited only by human creativity.</p>

    <p><strong>AVATAR:</strong> Graphical representation of the user in a virtual environment. Can range from simple geometric shapes to detailed humanoid figures.</p>

    <p><strong>BOOM:</strong> Binocular Omni-Orientation Monitor. Visualization device mounted on articulated mechanical arm, developed by Fakespace.</p>

    <p><strong>CAD:</strong> Computer Aided Design. Software used for creating technical drawings and three-dimensional models.</p>

    <p><strong>CAVE:</strong> Cave Automatic Virtual Environment. Virtual reality system that uses projections on multiple walls of a room to create an immersive environment.</p>

    <p><strong>CYBERSPACE:</strong> Term coined by William Gibson to describe the virtual space where computer-mediated interactions occur. Used as a synonym for virtual environment or computer network.</p>

    <p><strong>CYBERTIME:</strong> Concept describing the altered temporal experience in cyberspace, where traditional notions of linear time are modified by the instantaneity of electronic communications.</p>

    <p><strong>DATAGLOVE:</strong> Data glove. Input device that captures the movements of the user's hand and fingers for interaction with virtual environments.</p>

    <p><strong>STEREOSCOPIC DISPLAY:</strong> Visualization system that presents different images to each eye, creating the perception of depth and three-dimensionality.</p>

    <p><strong>STEREOSCOPY:</strong> Technique for creating the illusion of depth through the presentation of slightly different images to each eye.</p>

    <p><strong>HAPTIC FEEDBACK:</strong> Return of information through the sense of touch. May include vibration, resistance, and texture sensations.</p>

    <p><strong>TACTILE FEEDBACK:</strong> Return of information through the sense of touch, usually in the form of vibration or pressure.</p>

    <p><strong>FOV:</strong> Field of View. Viewing angle offered by a visualization device.</p>

    <p><strong>FRAME RATE:</strong> Number of images displayed per second. Higher rates result in smoother motion.</p>

    <p><strong>DEGREES OF FREEDOM:</strong> Number of dimensions in which an object can move. Six degrees of freedom (6DOF) include movement along X, Y, Z axes and rotation around each axis.</p>

    <p><strong>HMD:</strong> Head-Mounted Display. Helmet or glasses that display stereoscopic images directly in front of the user's eyes.</p>

    <p><strong>IMMERSION:</strong> Sensation of being physically present inside a virtual environment. Can be achieved through visual, auditory, and tactile stimuli.</p>

    <p><strong>INTERFACE:</strong> Means of communication between the user and the computational system. In VR, includes visualization, input, and feedback devices.</p>

    <p><strong>LATENCY:</strong> Delay between a user action and the system response. Low latency is essential for maintaining the illusion of presence.</p>

    <p><strong>TRACKING:</strong> Process of detecting and recording the position and orientation of the user or objects in space.</p>

    <p><strong>AUGMENTED REALITY:</strong> Technology that overlays digital information onto the real physical environment, enriching the user's perception.</p>

    <p><strong>VIRTUAL REALITY:</strong> Technology that allows the creation of synthetic three-dimensional environments in which the user can navigate and interact.</p>

    <p><strong>RENDERING:</strong> Process of generating images from three-dimensional models through computer graphics techniques.</p>

    <p><strong>SIMULATOR:</strong> System that reproduces characteristics and behaviors of a real environment or equipment for training or study purposes.</p>

    <p><strong>IMMERSIVE SYSTEM:</strong> Virtual reality system that involves multiple senses of the user to create the illusion of presence in a virtual environment.</p>

    <p><strong>TELEPRESENCE:</strong> Technology that allows the user to act and perceive in a remote environment through computational interfaces.</p>

    <p><strong>TEXTURE:</strong> Two-dimensional image applied to surfaces of three-dimensional objects to add visual details.</p>

    <p><strong>WORLD:</strong> File or data set that defines a virtual environment, including geometry, textures, behaviors, and interactions.</p>
