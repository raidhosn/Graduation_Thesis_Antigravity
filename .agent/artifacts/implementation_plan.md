# Implementation Plan - Launch and Verify Application

The objective is to ensure the graduation thesis application is running and accessible to the user.

## Current Status
- [x] Identify dev server command (`npm run dev`)
- [x] Start development server on port 8080
- [x] Verify server response via CLI (`curl`)
- [x] Confirm base path configuration (`/Graduation_Thesis_Antigravity/`)

## Next Steps
- [ ] Maintain the development server process.
- [ ] Assist the user with any navigation or UI debugging once they open the link in their local browser.
- [ ] Address any potential routing issues related to the custom base path.

## Verification
- Accessing `http://localhost:8080/Graduation_Thesis_Antigravity/` should render the main thesis page.
