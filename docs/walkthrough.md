# UI/UX Elevation: Refined Academic Modernism

The graduation thesis website has been transformed into a premium digital publication that balances scholarly elegance with 2026 digital standards.

## Key Enhancements

### 🎨 Atmosphere & Depth
Added a subtle warm gradient background with a high-end paper-like noise texture (2.5% opacity), creating a tactile, premium feel without sacrificing readability.

### 📚 Refined Typography
- **Reading Rhythm**: Improved vertical rhythm with a comfortable `1.75` line-height and optimized paragraph spacing.
- **Micro-details**: Added subtle letter-spacing (`-0.02em`) to chapter titles and upgraded subheadings for better hierarchy.

### ✨ Interactive Elements
- **Card Design**: TOC cards now feature `rounded-xl` corners, soft elegant shadows, and a subtle "lift" effect on hover.
- **Link Animations**: Implemented modern, animated underlines that grow from the center, complementing the academic tone.
- **Reading Progress**: Added a thin teal progress bar at the top of the reading panel to track progress through long chapters.

### 🎬 Professional Choreography
- **Scroll Reveals**: Sections now gently fade and slide into view as you scroll, using a performant `IntersectionObserver` pattern.
- **Page Load**: Integrated staggered entrance animations for hero elements and table of contents.

### 🏗️ Structural Upgrades
- **Premium Header**: The header now features a sophisticated `backdrop-blur-md` effect with a softer shadow and improved branding.
- **Bilingual Footer**: A refined footer section with scholarly attribution and easy language toggling.
